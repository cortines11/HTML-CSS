        I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this)<br>
        <br>
        Fate fell short this time<br>
        Your smile fades in the summer<br>
        Place your hand in mine<br>
        I'll leave when I wanna<br>
    </p>

                Where do we go from here?<br>
                Turn all the lights down now<br>
                Smilin' from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this)<br>
                Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this)<br>
                Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this)<br>
                Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this)<br>
                We're takin' this way too slow (I'm feelin' this)<br>
                Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this)<br>
                Fate fell short this time<br>
                Your smile fades in the summer<br>
                Place your hand in mine<br>
                I'll leave when I wanna 2x<br>

        This place was never the same again after you came and went<br>
        How could you say you meant anything<br>
        Different to anyone standin' alone on the<br>
        Street with a cigarette on the first night we met?<br>
        Look to the past and remember and smile<br>
        And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while<br>
        I'm not in this scene, I think I'm fallin' asleep<br>
        But then all that it means is I'll always be dreamin'of you<br>

            Fate fell short this time<br>
            Your smile fades in the summer (so lost and disillusioned)<br>
